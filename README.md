# A/B testing Assessment

My solution has two types of alerts when the user completes the subscription. 

In this project, I needed to apply an A/B test as a Brief, this should contain:

- At least one static section
- At least one dynamic section (your A/B test)
- At least one CTA with tracking
- This doesn’t have to be posted anywhere, it can be a console.log to the console with the proper naming convention and payload.
- Keep GDPR in mind.

Criteria: 
- Create an A/B test that doesn’t redirect the user to another page/URL.
- The technique of your choice should be implemented properly.
- Track user interactions.
